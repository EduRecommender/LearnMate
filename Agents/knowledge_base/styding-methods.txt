Abstract
This study aimed to investigate the relationship of students’ study habits and attitudes and their performance in licensure examinations. The participants were graduates in school year 2009-2010 from the different programs of the University which require licensure examination. The study habits and attitudes of the participants were assessed by administering the “Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes” (SSHA) developed by Brown and Holtzman (1967) during their final year in the University and their performance (overall rating) in the different licensure examinations was generated from the records of the Philippine Professional Regulation Commission. Results of the study showed that the participants do not have favorable study habits and attitudes. Among the noted unfavorable study habits were inefficient time management, lack of planning and concentration in their studies, poor skills in reading, ineffective test taking techniques, and failure to inform their teachers of their difficulties with school work and ask for their help. The participants also demonstrated unfavorable attitudes toward teachers’ classroom behavior and methods. It was further revealed that their performance in licensure examinations was quite low. Significant relationship between study habits and attitudes and performance in licensure examination were clearly shown in this study. Further analysis revealed that study habits (work methods and time management) of the participants were correlated with their success in licensure examination while study attitudes (i.e. attitudes toward teachers and educational acceptance) were not significantly related to success in licensure examination. This connotes that students who have favorable study habits will likely pass the licensure examination.

Keywords: study habits, study attitudes, academic performance.

Introduction
Student’s academic performance occupies a very important place in education as well as in the learning process. It is considered as a key criterion to judge one’s total potentialities and capacities (Nuthana & Yenagi, 2009) which are frequently measured by the examination results. It is used to pass judgment on the quality of education offered by academic institutions. In fact, it is still the most topical debate in higher learning institutions that caused great concern to educators and researchers due to the alarming examination performance of students.


In the report of the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) on performance of graduates in the different licensure and board examinations, data show that performance of graduates has been declining in the last ten years. The overall passing rates are quite low (around 36% on the average). In the 2010 professional licensure examinations given by the PRC, almost 70 percent of college graduates in the country failed and, last year, only 125,419 of the 345,182 or 36.3 percent college and technical school graduates passed their respective professional eligibility examinations as per PRC records. These statistics were based on the results of licensure examinations for 45 groups of professionals.  Among the lowest number of passing rates were posted by: elementary teachers (15.4 percent); secondary teachers (23.3 percent); electronics engineers (23.5 percent); and registered electrical engineers (31.9 percent) (Philippine Education_Sector Assessment Project, 2011). What explains these performance discrepancies? Multiple reports indicate that academic success cannot be predicted by a single variable. It is dependent upon many factors; both cognitive and non-cognitive.

Numerous studies have been carried out which focused on cognitive factors as predictors of academic success. Recently, there has been a growing interest on the non-cognitive factors. A number of researchers have examined the role of non-cognitive variables such as study skills (Fazal, S. et.al, 2012; Awang, G & Sinnadurai, S.K., 2011; Demir et. al, 2012; Hassanbeigi et.al, 2011), study motivation (Tella, A., 2007; Nonis and Hudson, 2008), study behavior (Yang Yang, 2011; Otto, 1978), study habits (Crede and Kuncel, 2008; Nuthana & Yenagi, 2009; Nouhi et.al, 2008; Bashir et. al, 2012; Boehler, 2001; Kurshid, 2012; Mutsotso et. al, 2010), and attitudes (Sarwar et.al, 2010 and  Yu, 2011)  on academic achievement. Some argued that these factors have strong relationship with academic performance of students while others concluded that it was the combination of the different factors that could explain students’ academic performance.

In a more recent meta-analysis, Crede and Kuncel (2008) found that non-cognitive factors like study habit, skill and study motivation, among other attitudinal constructs, accounted for incremental variance in academic performance beyond standardized tests and previous grades. Moreover, a literature review by Nagaraju (2004) pointed out that, for good academic success, good study habits and attitudes are important. Hence, it is imperative and desirable that a probe into the pattern of study habits and attitudes of students be made. 



Statement of the problem/research questions

This study has its primary objective to assess the study habits and attitudes of the students and their relationship to performance outcomes in licensure examinations. Specifically, the study was organized around the following questions:

What are the study habits and attitudes of the students?
How did the students perform in the licensure examinations?
Are students’ study habits and attitudes correlated with board examination performance?


Significance of the study

A number of studies pointed out that study habits and attitudes are important in academic success. Hence, it is important and desirable that a probe into the pattern of study habits and attitudes of the students and its relationship with licensure examination performance be made.

Outcomes of this study may form the basis for future intervention programs which aim at improving students’ study habits and attitudes that will eventually improve their performance outcomes in licensure examinations, which is an indicator of quality education in higher institutions of learning.



Literature review

This section discusses the factors that are well known to influence students’ academic achievement. 



Theoretical framework 

This study was based on Martin Ford’s Motivational Systems Theory (MST). This framework focuses on the individual as the unit of analysis, but embeds the individual in the biological, social, and environmental contexts that are crucial to development. Ford proposed a simple mathematical formula that attempts to represent all these factors in one model. The formula for effective person-in-context functioning is: 



Achievement = (Motivation x Skill) x Responsive Environment



The formula proposes that actual “achievement and competence are the results of a motivated, skillful, and biologically capable person interacting with a responsive environment” (Ford, 1992). 

Similar formula was used by Pinder (1984) and others (cited in Nonis & Hudson, 2006) to demonstrate performance as a multiplicative function of both ability and motivation.



Performance = Ability x Motivation 



The above formula indicates that a student with very high ability but low motivation is unlikely to perform well, whereas a student with low ability but high motivation is likely to perform well. That is, the variability in motivation across students may dampen associations between ability and performance. In the same vein, one can argue that it is simply the study habits and attitudes that ultimately bring about the desired performance and not students’ inner desires or motivations. Therefore, similar to how motivation interacts with ability to influence academic performance, one can infer that study habits and attitudes interact with ability to influence student performance in board examination.



Board Exam Performance = Ability x (Study Habits and Attitudes)



Students academic performance

Academic performance of students has been the subject of intensive research over the past years. It has become an issue of standards and quality in education as judged from the performance of students in national licensure and board examinations. However, various reports have documented the poor examination performance of students. For example the report of the PRC on performance of graduates in the different licensure and board examinations which has been declining in the last ten years. The overall passing rates are quite low (around 36% on the average). In the 2010 professional licensure examinations given by the PRC, almost 70 percent of college graduates in the country failed and, last year, only 125,419 of the 345,182 or 36.3 percent college and technical school graduates passed their respective professional eligibility examinations, as per PRC records. This statistics were based on the results of licensure examinations for 45 groups of professionals. Among the lowest number of passing rates were posted by: elementary teachers (15.4 percent); secondary teachers (23.3 percent); electronic engineers (23.5 percent); and registered electrical engineers (31.9 percent) (Philippine Education Sector Assessment Project, 2011).  Other report provided data about education standard; indicating that deterioration had occurred in all fields of education in the society.

The low performance of students in licensure examinations has important ramifications to educators, schools and the educational system in general. Hence, there is a need to look into the factors that contribute to the academic performance of students.



Study habits and attitudes of students

Many studies have analyzed the factors behind the performance of students. Earlier studies have been carried out which focused on cognitive factors as predictors of academic success. Recently, there has been a growing interest on the non-cognitive factors. A number of researchers have examined the role of non-cognitive variables such as study skills (Fazal, S. et.al, 2012; Awang, G & Sinnadurai, S.K., 2011; Demir et. al, 2012; Hassanbeigi et.al, 2011), study motivation (Tella, A., 2007; Nonis and Hudson, 2008), study behavior (Yang Yang, 2011; Otto, 1978), study habits (Crede and Kuncel, 2008; Nuthana & Yenagi, 2009; Nouhi et.al, 2008; Bashir et. al, 2012; Boehler, 2001; Kurshid, 2012; Mutsotso et. al, 2010), and attitudes (Sarwar et.al, 2010 and  Yu, 2011)  on academic achievement. Some argued that these factors have strong relationship with academic performance of students, while others concluded that it was the combination of the different factors that could explain students’ academic performance.

In a more recent meta-analysis, Crede and Kuncel (2008) found that non-cognitive factors like study habit, skill and study motivation, among other attitudinal constructs, accounted for incremental variance in academic performance beyond standardized tests and previous grades. Moreover, a literature review by Nagaraju (2004) pointed out that for good academic success, good study habits and attitudes are important. 

Study habit is the pattern of behavior adopted by students in the pursuit of their studies that serves as the vehicle of learning. It is the degree to which the student engages in regular acts of studying that are characterized by appropriate studying routines (e.g. reviews of material, frequency of studying sessions, etc.) occurring in an environment that is conducive to studying. Study attitudes, on the other hand, refers to a student’s positive attitude toward the specific act of studying and the student’s acceptance and approval of the broader goals of college education (Crede and Kuncel, 2008). In short, study habits and attitudes of students are determined through their time management ability, work methods, attitudes toward teachers and acceptance of education.

A review of literature highlighted the importance of students study habits and attitudes in their academic performance. According to Menzel, cited by Rana and Kausar (2011), many students fail not because they lack ability but because they do not have adequate study skills. Students who have difficulty in college frequently do not have adequate study habits that affect their academic achievement. A central problem noted was that many of these students had not learned how to take effective notes and manage time for studying (cited by Mutsotso S.N. & Abenga E.S., 2010). Moreover, a study by Nagaraju (2004) found that students usually do not devote sufficient time to their studies and seldom have proper study habits. 

Efficient study habits are associated with a favorable attitude toward learning in general. As cited by Otto (1978), beliefs in the value of intellectual pursuits and in the importance of education are positively related to academic performance. An important aspect of a student’s attitude toward education is the value he sees in what he has to learn. In the study of Sarwar et. al (2010), it was discovered that a significant relationship between student attitudes and academic performance exists. Another research found discrepancy between the study attitudes of high and low-achieving students. High-achieving students had a more positive attitude toward study in that they detected and reacted positively to the favorable aspects of the situation they found themselves in, while the low-achieving students tended to be fault-finders, reacting to the negative aspects of study such as distractions and minor annoyances. The high-achieving students found tertiary work an interesting challenge, accepted the restrictions and conformed to the demands made upon them more readily, while the low achievers appeared to lack high-level motivation. The more successful group was also found to be more realistic and discriminating in their assessment of those situations which were highly relevant to scholastic achievement, such as discipline and work priorities, and they were better organized in both their work and leisure activities.

In terms of attitude towards teachers, the high achievers generally have a positive attitude towards teachers. For instance, as compared to low achievers, the high achievers more often say that their teachers are competent, impartial, and interested in their duties (Sarwar, M., Bashir, M., Khan, M.N., & Khan, M.S., 2009). Yu (2011) in his study revealed that among the SHSA factors examined, student perception of teacher effectiveness influence accounting performance. 



Study habits and attitudes in relation to academic performance

A substantial amount of research has examined the role of students’ study habits and their attitudes to study on academic performance. The study of Osa-Edoh and Alutu (2012) which examined the usefulness of imbibing in the students study habit, as a means of enhancing their academic performance, revealed a high correlation between study habits and students academic performance. This suggests that it is only when students imbibe or cultivate proper study habits that their academic performance can be improved upon. 

Similarly, Nuthana and Yenagi (2009) found significant correlation between study habits and academic achievement. It further revealed that reading and note-taking habits, habits of concentration, and preparation for examination had significant correlation with academic achievement. The authors pointed out that students who are better in reading and note-taking, well prepared for the board examination and have concentration may have better academic achievement. An association between study skills and academic performance also has been found to prevail among undergraduate students. The study of Fazal (2012) identified various study skills used by learners and ascertain which study skills is more related to academic achievement. Results of the study indicate significant relationship of time-management skills, reading and note-taking skills with academic achievement. Students with higher academic achievement used a wide range of study skills as compared to students with lower academic achievement.

Another study was conducted using a Q factor analysis to understand the study behavior and habits of undergraduate students. The Q factor analysis was used to classify students as either proactive learners with well-organized study behavior or disorganized procrastinators based on their self-reported study behavior. Findings of the study showed a significant difference in the academic performance of the two groups of students. Student type was found to be a significant predictor of academic achievement beyond and above students’ attribute variables (Yang, 2011).

Nonis and Hudson (2010) also conducted a study on performance of college students-impact of study time and study habits in which they found that some study habits had a positive direct relationship on student performance but others had a negative direct relationship. 

Hassanbeigi et al. (2011), in their study of the relationship between various study skills and academic performance of university students, noted that the study skills scores of students with GPA of 15 and above (out of 20) were statistically higher than those students with GPA of less than 15 in all of the seven skills (time management and procrastination, concentration and memory, study aids and note-taking, test strategies and test anxiety, organizing and processing information, motivation and attitude, and reading and selecting the main idea). 

Because of the importance of study habits and attitudes on academic performance, some researchers have proposed strategies that will help students develop effective study habits and attitudes. For example, the study of Demir et al. (2012), which examined the effect of development of efficient studying skills curriculum on academic achievements and studying skills of learners, found that students can acquire efficient studying skills by means of curriculum for developing efficient studying skills. The students were able to organize the study environment and use specific methods effectively, such as efficient reading, listening lectures, note-taking, efficient writing and doing homework. It further revealed that those students where the curriculum was implemented have increased academic achievement as compared to the group of students on which the curriculum was not implemented. Mutsotso and Abenga (2010) also propose a paradigm shift in study methods and suggest strategies for both lecturers and the students in universities towards improved learning and performance. It is based on the “distributed learning approach” that adequately cater for individual differences that exist among the students. The model will address the study space needs and the efficiency and effectiveness of study methods.

To sum up, the literatures cited point to the importance of study habits and attitudes to academic performance or success of students.

The figure shows how the variables of the study are related. The study habits and attitudes of the students could influence their performance outcomes in licensure examinations.



Methods
A descriptive correlational research design was used for this study to examine the relationship of students’ study habits and attitudes to their performance in the licensure examinations.

The respondents were graduates in school year 2009-2010 from the different programs of the University which require licensure examination. A total of 239 students comprised of 127 males and 112 females participated in the study. Table 1 shows the distribution of the respondents.



Table 1: Distribution of the respondents

Table 1: Distribution of the respondents
The study habits and attitudes of the respondents were assessed by administering the “Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes” (SSHA) developed by Brown and Holtzman (1969) during their final year in the University. The SSHA consists of 100 items divided equally into four (4) subscales named as ‘work methods (WM)’, ‘delay avoidance (DA)’, ‘teacher approval (TA)’ and ‘educational acceptance (EA)’.  The subscales are used to formulate two subtotals; summation of scores obtained from WM and DA forms a score for ‘Study Habits (SH)’ and the total score obtained from the summation of TA and EA yield a ‘study attitudes (SA)’ score. The Study Habits measure student's time management ability and work methods whereas Study Attitudes measure student’s opinions about teacher’s classroom management and behavior and his/her acceptance of education.

The performance rating of the graduates was generated from the data released by the PRC. It is the overall rating obtained by the graduates in the licensure examinations.

Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, and percentile ranks) were used to describe the study habits and attitudes of the students and their performance in licensure examinations. Moreover, relationship of study habits and attitudes with performance in licensure examination was examined by the use of Pearson correlation coefficient. 



Results

Table 2: Study habits and attitudes score of the respondents

Table 2: Study habits and attitudes score of the respondents
Analysis of the scores obtained from the SSHA revealed that the respondents do not have very effective approaches in studying.  As reflected in the table, the respondents score in the 50-60th percentile on Study Habits which means they scored at average level. This result suggests that the respondents’ use of study skills is not efficient and effective. Among the noted unfavorable study habits of the students were inefficient time management, lack of planning and concentration in their studies, poor skills in reading, ineffective test-taking techniques, and failure to inform their teachers of their difficulties with school work and ask for their help.

Similarly, the respondents recorded Study Attitudes in the 35-45th percentile which is interpreted as average low. The result indicates that the respondents do not have favorable attitudes toward the teacher classroom behavior and practices. Moreover, the respondents certainly do not approve educational objectives, practices and requirements.

Figure 2: Study habits and attitude score of respondents from the different programs
Figure 2 reveals the study habits and attitudes score of the respondents from the different programs.  

The Education (Secondary) and Nursing graduates obtained the highest scores on Study Habits which is interpreted as average high. This result suggests that graduates of these programs exert more effort in their study skills and have efficient time management as compared to graduates of the other programs.

In terms of study attitudes, the Nursing, Civil Engineering and the Geodetic Engineering graduates recorded the highest mean scores. However, these scores are still categorized as average low. The result clearly shows that graduates perceptions of teacher’s classroom behavior and methods are not favorable and their acceptance of educational objectives and practices are not desirable.

Figure 3: Performance rating in licensure examinations
Figure 3 shows the performance rating of graduates in the different licensure examinations.  It is observed from the figure that the graduates did not perform very well in the licensure examination. The overall mean performance rating is quite low (75.3%). The Accountancy graduates obtained the highest rating which means they have higher cognitive ability. However, in terms of the passing rate for first takers, it was the Nursing graduates who achieved the highest percentage.



Table 3: Correlation between SSHA score and performance rating in licensure examination 

Table 3: Correlation between SSHA score and performance rating in licensure examination 
It is apparent from the table that study habits and attitude scores of the respondents are significantly related to their performance rating in the licensure examination. This means that the study habits and attitudes of the respondents may contribute to their performance rating in the licensure examination. However, it is not sufficient to conclude that those who have effective study habits and attitudes have higher ratings in the licensure exam. As revealed in this study, mental capability of students still accounts for their performance in the licensure examination. Further analysis using stepwise linear regression revealed that students work methods could predict their performance in licensure and board examinations.



Table 4: SSHA vis-à-vis success in licensure examinations

Table 4: SSHA vis-à-vis success in licensure examinations
It is revealed in table 4 that study habits of graduates had significant correlation with their success in licensure examination, while study attitudes (i.e. attitudes toward teachers and educational acceptance) were not significantly related to success in licensure examination. This connotes that graduates who have favorable study habits will likely pass the licensure examination.



Discussions
Results of the study showed that the students did not possess a favorable study habits and attitudes. Based from their responses, it was revealed that the students do not have efficient time management, they lack planning and concentration in their studies, they have poor skills in reading, ineffective test-taking techniques and failure to inform their teachers of their difficulties with school work and ask for their help. Similar results were identified by Nouhi et al. (2008) as students’ weakness in study. The findings were also noted in the study of Aquino (2011) and Nagaragu (2004). It was suggested in a literature review by Sarwar et al. (2009) that student should draw up a time table for study which enables the learner to organize his study effectively. Furthermore, positive study attitudes which are a driving force behind study habits should be adopted by the student in order to succeed.

Another revelation from this study was the overall performance of the students in the licensure examinations, which is at average level.  This situation is prevailing in many institutions of higher learning where few students perform excellently. It was evident in the report of the PRC that performance of graduates in the different licensure and board examinations has been declining. The overall passing rates were quite low. This was also supported by other research about education standard, indicating that deterioration had occurred in all branches of education in the society.

The study further revealed significant relationships between students study habits and attitudes and their performance outcomes in the licensure examinations. This result was consistent with the findings of earlier studies (Crede and Kuncel, 2008; Nuthana & Yenagi, 2009; Awang & Sinnadurai, 2011; Khurshid, F. et al., 2012; Osa-Edoh and Alutu, 2012; Nonis and Hudson, 2010), which reported significant correlation between study habits and academic achievement, contrary to the findings of Nouhi et al. (2008) and Boehler et al. (2001). In the present study, the unfavorable study habits and attitudes of the students may have contributed to their low performance in the licensure examinations. As stated in literature cited by Rana and Kausar (2011), many students fail not because they lack ability but because they do not have adequate study skills. Students who have difficulty in college frequently do not have adequate study habits that affect their academic achievement. A central problem noted was that many of these students had not learned how to take effective notes and manage time for studying (cited by Mutsotso S.N. & Abenga E.S., 2010). Furthermore, a study by Nagaraju (2004) found that students usually do not devote sufficient time to their studies and seldom have proper study habits.

In studies comparing the study habits and attitudes of high and low-achieving students, data indicated that high achievers have better study habits and attitudes than the low achievers (Hassanbeigi et al., 2011; Sarwar et al., 2009). This was confirmed in the present study. Students who acquired higher study habits and attitudes scores have better performance in the licensure examination. According to Fazal (2012), students with higher academic achievement used a wide range of study skills as compared to students with lower academic achievement.  A detailed analysis of some of the study skills that successful students possess were work-knowledge, note-taking ability, and linguistic intelligence. The study of Nuthana and Yenagi (2009) further revealed that students who are better in reading and note-taking, well prepared for the board examination and have concentration may have better academic achievement. 

Meanwhile, a research which investigated the relationship between student attitudes and examination performance found significant relationship (Sarwar et. al., 2010). Similar result was found in the present study. The unfavorable attitudes of students toward teacher’s classroom management and behavior and their acceptance of education could have influenced their low performance in licensure examinations. As cited by Otto (1978), beliefs in the value of intellectual pursuits and in the importance of education are positively related to academic performance. This was supported by the study of Yu (2010) that, of all the study skills examined, students’ perception of teacher effectiveness influenced students’ academic performance. A discrepancy in study attitudes between high and low-achieving students was also noted in other researches. High-achieving students had a more positive attitude toward study in that they detected and reacted positively to the favorable aspects of the situation they found themselves in, while the low-achieving students tended to be fault-finders, reacting to the negative aspects of study such as distractions and minor annoyances. The high-achieving students found tertiary work an interesting challenge, accepted the restrictions and conformed to the demands made upon them more readily, while the low achievers appeared to lack high-level motivation. The more successful group was also found to be more realistic and discriminating in their assessment of those situations which were highly relevant to scholastic achievement, such as discipline and work priorities, and they were better organized in both their work and leisure activities (cited by Otto, 1978). In terms of attitude towards teachers, the high achievers generally have a positive attitude towards teachers. The high achievers often say that teachers are competent, impartial and interested in their duties (Sarwar et al., 2009). 



Conclusion and implication
The belief that academic success required not only high cognitive ability but also sound study habits and attitudes (SHAs) was confirmed in the present study. A significant correlation between students’ study habits and attitudes and their performance in licensure examinations was clearly shown in the present study. Thus, to enhance the quality of education, there is a need to improve the study habits and attitudes of the students. This could be done through provision of developmental programs that will help students build efficient and effective study habits and positive attitudes towards learning, in an early stage of their studies. Engaging students in educationally purposeful activities that will result in high levels of learning and personal development for all students is likewise suggested.

Quantitative Method (Survey Questionnaire)

Document Analysis

 

Among the SHSA factors, only student perception of teacher effectiveness and level of effort influence accounting performance. Time spent studying, attendance in review classes conducted in tutorial centers, motivation, and study habits have no significant effect. Further analysis comparing high and low performers showed that study habits were significant. Students who performed better are those who did more in terms of reading ahead, doing their homework, participating in class, and cramming for exams.
