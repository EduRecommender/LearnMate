    # TASK: STUDY PLAN VERIFICATION AND IMPROVEMENT
    
    ## GOAL
    Review the proposed study plan against strict requirements and improve it to ensure all criteria are met fully.
    
    ## VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
    The study plan MUST meet ALL of the following requirements:
    
    1. **STRICT TIME CONSTRAINTS**: 
       - The total study time MUST EXACTLY match days Ã— hours per day (within 30 minutes)
       - Each day should use approximately the allocated hours per day
       - Break times must be included in the total time calculation
    
    2. **COMPLETE TOPIC COVERAGE**: 
       - EVERY topic from the syllabus must be covered
       - No topic should be missing or insufficiently addressed
       
    3. **SPECIFIC RESOURCE REFERENCES**:
       - Each resource must specify exact chapters, page numbers, or timestamps
       - The syllabus itself should NEVER be recommended as a study resource
       - Each resource must be clearly linked to specific learning activities
       
    4. **EVIDENCE-BASED STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION**:
       - Each study session must specify which evidence-based strategy to use
       - Strategies must be appropriate for the topic and resource
       - The 3R strategy and other evidence-based methods must be properly implemented
       
    5. **ACTIONABLE INSTRUCTIONS**:
       - Each study session must have clear, specific instructions
       - Instructions must be detailed enough to follow without additional decisions
       
    6. **PRECISE TIME ALLOCATION**:
       - Each activity must have a specific time allocation in minutes
       - Time allocations must be realistic and appropriate for the activity
       
    7. **BREAK INCLUSION**:
       - Appropriate breaks must be scheduled between study sessions
       - Break durations must be specified in minutes
       
    8. **REVIEW SESSIONS**:
       - Regular review sessions must be included
       - Review sessions should use spaced repetition principles
    
    ## EXPECTED OUTPUT
    If the study plan meets ALL requirements, approve it. If ANY requirement is not met:
    1. Identify specific issues with detailed explanations
    2. Fix ALL issues to create an improved final plan
    3. Format the improved plan with clear day-by-day structure
    4. Return verification notes and the improved plan
    
    The final study plan MUST be comprehensive, clearly formatted, and ready for the student to follow without any further adjustments.
