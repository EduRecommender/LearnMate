This will help solidify concepts and identify areas where you need more practice or review.\n2. **Focus on key concepts and summarize in your own words**: As you read through the chapters, take notes and try to summarize the main ideas in your own words. This will help you understand and retain the material better.\n3. **Practice problems and coding exercises are crucial**: Make sure to allocate time for practicing problems or coding exercises related to Computer Vision. This will help you apply what you've learned and identify areas where you need more practice.\n4. **Take regular breaks**: Don't forget to take short breaks every 30-45 minutes to refresh your mind and avoid burnout.\n5. **Review flashcards regularly**: Create flashcards for key terms and concepts, and review them regularly to reinforce learning and retention.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any questions or concerns about the plan!", "timestamp": "2025-04-20T18:12:59.562317"}, "completed_at": "2025-04-20T18:12:59.575260", "processing_time": 24.85135793685913}
