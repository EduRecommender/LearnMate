It seems like we're starting fresh, so let's take a step back and review what we've covered so far. We didn't get to explore any specific topics or concepts earlier.\n\nLet's start from scratch! What are your goals for learning Computer Vision? Are you interested in understanding the basics of image processing, or do you have a particular application in mind (e.g., self-driving cars, medical imaging, etc.)?\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts, and we can work together to create a personalized study plan that suits your needs.", "timestamp": "2025-04-20T20:53:57.783900"}, "completed_at": "2025-04-20T20:53:57.811864", "processing_time": 14.189187288284302}
