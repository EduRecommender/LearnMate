As we discussed earlier, the study plan is designed to help you learn and master Computer Vision concepts in 30 days.\n\nTo better understand your current needs or concerns, I'd like to ask some clarifying questions:\n\n1. Are there specific topics in the study plan that you're having trouble understanding or would like more clarification on?\n2. Have you had any experience with Computer Vision previously (e.g., through online courses, projects, or research papers)?\n3. What are your goals for learning about Computer Vision? Are you looking to apply it in a particular field (e.g., robotics, healthcare, computer graphics), or do you want to explore its theoretical aspects?\n\nPlease share any thoughts, and I'll do my best to provide helpful guidance and support!\n\nCURRENT QUESTION: ?", "timestamp": "2025-04-20T20:58:47.704182"}, "completed_at": "2025-04-20T20:58:47.717827", "processing_time": 23.0847909450531}
