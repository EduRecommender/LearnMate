It involves three stages: proposal generation, feature extraction, and classification.\n\n* **Proposal Generation**: Use Selective Search or Edge Boxes to generate region proposals.\n* **Feature Extraction**: Extract features from each proposal using a convolutional neural network (CNN).\n* **Classification**: Classify each proposal into an object category (e.g., \"car,\" \"person\") using the extracted features.\n\n**Fast R-CNN**: Fast R-CNN is an improved version of R-CNN that uses a single network for both proposal generation and classification. This reduces the computational cost and improves detection accuracy.\n\n* **Proposal Generation**: Use a CNN to generate proposals directly, eliminating the need for separate proposal generation.\n* **Classification**: Classify each proposal into an object category using the same CNN used for proposal generation.\n\n**YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: YOLO is a real-time object detector that detects objects in one pass, without the need for region proposals. It's designed for fast and accurate detection.\n\n* **Single Pass Detection**: Detect objects in a single forward pass through the network.\n* **Non-Maximum Suppression**: Apply NMS to remove duplicate detections and refine bounding box coordinates.\n\nThese algorithms have their strengths and weaknesses. R-CNN is accurate but slow, while Fast R-CNN is faster but less accurate. YOLO is fast and accurate but may not perform as well on complex scenes.\n\nWhich algorithm would you like to learn more about?", "timestamp": "2025-04-20T21:38:17.315761"}, "completed_at": "2025-04-20T21:38:17.704414", "processing_time": 95.53681087493896}
