They help you understand how well your model performs on various aspects like accuracy, completeness, and false positives.\n\nDo you have any questions about these metrics or would you like me to elaborate on any of them?\n\nWhat's your next question?\nPlease go ahead and ask!", "timestamp": "2025-04-20T00:01:33.451112"}, "completed_at": "2025-04-20T00:01:33.498931", "processing_time": 28.361928939819336}
