It involves dividing an image into its constituent parts or regions based on certain criteria like color, texture, or shape.\n\nWe've already looked at **Thresholding**, **Edge-based Segmentation**, and **Region Growing** as different approaches to image segmentation. Each technique has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of approach depends on the specific task and characteristics of the input image.\n\nNow that we have a solid foundation in image segmentation techniques, would you like to explore some real-world applications or learn more about active contours?\n\nPlease let me know how I can further assist you!", "timestamp": "2025-04-20T18:21:09.349705"}, "completed_at": "2025-04-20T18:21:09.366112", "processing_time": 15.029436826705933}
